        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>The best burger recipe for summertime grilling! This juicy burger is jam-packed with all kinds of stuff and has no tasteless bread crumbs. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments. </p>

            Make four patties. 
            Grill the patties until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink in the center.

    Cooked on a grill heated to high heat, these hamburger patties should be fully cooked after about 4 to 5 minutes per side.
